## The Development Journey  

### Phase 1 & 2: Foundation & Configuration  
- Defined requirements for **customer feedback lifecycle**.  
- Set up Salesforce **Experience Cloud site** for external customers.  
- Configured **secure sharing settings** for guest and registered users.  

### Phase 3: Data Modeling  
- Built `CustomerFeedback__c` object.  
- Added fields for **feedback text, sentiment, score, and processed flag**.  
- Established lookup relationships for agent assignment.  

### Phase 4: Process Automation  
- Validation Rule â†’ Feedback text must be provided.  
- Record-Triggered Flow â†’ Create Case automatically if sentiment is **Negative**.  

### Phase 5: Python AI Integration  
- Developed Python script with **TextBlob/Hugging Face** for sentiment analysis.  
- Used `simple-salesforce` for CRUD operations on Salesforce records.  
- Automated updates for sentiment score & classification.  
- Scheduled with **Windows Task Scheduler / GitHub Actions**.  

### Phase 6: User Authentication (Registration & Login)  
- Custom **Registration & Login LWCs** integrated with `Registration__c` object.  
- Implemented **password hashing (SHA-256)** for secure storage.  
- Enforced password rules: 10+ chars, uppercase, number, special character.  

### Phase 7: User Interface Development  
- Built **Feedback Portal** with Lightning Web Components.  
- Added Registration â†” Login redirects.  
- Created UI for feedback submission, FAQs, and discussion forums.  

### Phase 8: Advanced AI Extensions  
- Integrated **Einstein Bots** for automated responses.  
- Experimented with **GPT-powered suggestions** for agent replies.  

### Phase 9: Reporting & Dashboards  
- Dashboards created for:  
  - Sentiment distribution (Positive, Neutral, Negative).  
  - Feedback volume trends.  
  - Agent resolution performance.  
- Reports for executives to monitor **CX health** and prevent churn.  

### Phase 10: Final Delivery & Demo  
- Full demo flow:  
  1. Customer registers â†’ logs in â†’ submits feedback.  
  2. Python script analyzes feedback â†’ updates Salesforce.  
  3. Negative feedback â†’ auto case creation for agent.  
  4. Dashboard updates in real-time.  
- Demonstrated **business impact**: faster resolutions, AI-driven insights, improved customer satisfaction.
